# Cross-Company Mapper (POC)

This repository contains a proof-of-concept project for cross-company data mapping (homework).

Structure created:

- `mapping-service/`    — Java (Spring Boot) service (placeholder)
- `validation-service/` — Python (Flask/FastAPI) service (placeholder)
- `frontend/`           — React + TypeScript app (placeholder)
- `docker-compose.yml`  — stub compose to run services together
- `AI_USAGE.md`         — AI usage documentation (placeholder)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`     — short architecture decisions (placeholder)

Next steps:
1. Implement the mapping service in Java (Spring Boot).
2. Implement the validation service in Python (FastAPI recommended).
3. Bootstrapped React+TypeScript frontend to upload JSON and show mapping suggestions.
4. Integrate AI API for mapping suggestions and rule generation.

Time log:
- Mapping service: 1h:15m
- Validation service: 30m
- Frontend: 30m
- Integration & infra: 30m
- Fixing the generated code: 2h 15m
